    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Slides from the 1400+ computers in 3 weeks? Are you nuts?!? session at PSU Mac Admins Conference 2013</h2>

<p>If you were in my presentation, or even if you weren't, and would like a copy of my slides, I've posted them below.</p>

<p>As a reminder, I'll have a <a href="http://seankaiser.com/redirects/psumacadmins2013/">blog post</a> in the next couple of days with links to the various sources of information that I used to build our deployment system, as well as some expanded notes on why I designed things the way I did.</p>

<p>I'm offering the slides in two versions: <a href="http://bit.ly/16dsnR3">PDF</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/13OX4bD">keynote file</a> (in case you want the multisite reposado demo video mainly... or in case you really liked the transitions.)</p>

<p>More information on <a href="http://seankaiser.com/blog/2013/05/23/multi-site-reposado/">multi-site reposado</a> is also available.</p>

<p>If you attended my session, thank you. I hope that I offered something that will help you deploy your own modular deployment system. If you have any questions, you can reach me via twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/seankaiser">@seankaiser</a>. Or, if you would like to contact me via email, my email is my first name -at- seankaiser.com.</p>
